_(Note: I performed this ananlysis in 2022, and have since improved my skills since then. I have revised my code and actually found a slightly more optimal solution. As such, the optimal divisions in the writeup are not the same optimal divisions that appear in the python notebook. The Seahawks and the Raiders have switched divisions, and the Panthers and the Bills have switched divisions. Two small changes that lead to slightly more optimal division alignments. I appreciate your understanding this error)_
